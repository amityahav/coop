# coop

I was curious how user-space threads library could be implemented so i built a minimalistic library that does so. i was inspired by [this](https://brennan.io/2020/05/24/userspace-cooperative-multitasking/) great blog post that helped me to get the idea of one of the ways this can be achieved.
this is an educational project of course and not practical for production usage.
### Further improvements (that i wish to do in the future):

- Non-blocking IO 
- Preemptive scheduling
